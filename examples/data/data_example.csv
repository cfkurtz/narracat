,"A hundred people 3","My cousin just retired, he was working at one of those custom manufacturing places down on route 50, do you know them? Anyway, when he left he made a list of a hundred people he knew at work, and their phone numbers and emails and all, so he could stay in touch. I thought, do I have a hundred people here I would want to keep in touch with? Do I have thirty? Says something about this place. Or maybe just about me.","Maureen","Organization",,,,"I heard about it second hand",,,,,,,,,"other","my cousin",,,,,"disappointed",,,52,32,55,82,"61 and up"
,"Working its way down 3","It's not a pretty story. The people who made the mistake would not own up to the mistake. It worked its way down. The person who ultimately got stuck with it had nothing to do with it. They were just the most defenceless. It's just the way we do things here. Nobody talks about it. It's impossible.","Joe","Organization",,,,,"it's a rumor and I'm not sure if it's true",,,,,,,"not sure",,,,,,"angry",,"hopeless",,9,48,12,83,"41-60"
