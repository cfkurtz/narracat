"The lost project","Never made it to the deadline. The people on top canned it. Brutal.",,"Top-down control",,,,
"The project from heaven","Everything went right, we all learned a lot, and we made something worth having. Nothing better. Somehow all the pieces just fit together.","they confiscated his card","Teamwork","Somehow",,,
"N/A","So this guy comes in and it's one day after his contract ends and they confiscated his card and said don't come back. After three years of hard work. I mean, they could have at least said thanks or something.",,"Top-down control","Unfairness","Somehow",,
"Little cabinets","My dad worked long and hard, but when he retired he said he wished he had become a carpenter. Now he's having a ball making little intricate cabinets. Makes you wonder.",,"Somehow","Alternative life",,,
"Crane job","I watched a guy get crushed by a crane. It was a long time ago. The safety procedures we have today, it could never happen. That guy would have lived. I see his kids sometimes. Sad.",,"Unfairness","Top-down control","Somehow",,
"Responsibility","Responsibility? I came in every day and worked hard. Last month they told me to find another job. Who had responsibility to whom, and who kept their word? ",,"Unfairness","Top-down control",,,
"No problem","Last week I was working in the lab and I dropped a big glass thing that must have cost thousands of dollars. My manager was great about it. He said “happens to everybody” and just ordered another one. I don't know if I would have been as understanding.",,"Superhero","Teamwork",,,
"Speed bumps","Why do they have those stupid speed bumps in the parking lot? Do they think the adult employees here will run donuts in the parking lot? And at the same time they expect us to work long hours and do amazing things. These contradictory messages are demoralizing. I put in an anonymous comment about that. As if they care.",,"Clueless","Top-down control",,,
"My idea","The greatest moment I had last year was when my anonymous idea got taken up. I am not going to say what it was. It was something I thought of one day at lunch, a way to help us all be more productive. No, I will not tell you what it was. But when I saw it actually being built, my heart just about burst with pride. That was MY idea folks. ",,"Superhero","Nasty piece of work","Alternative life",,
"Popcorn","This guy I heard about was in late at night, right? Trying to finish up a report that was due the next day. His boss asked him to do it, he begged to be let off but the boss  said it was “top priority.” So he's there working, tired, on his third cup of coffee, and he hears a noise in the next office. Being conscientious he goes to check. It's the boss. So this guy didn't say anything, he just watched. The boss was watching a movie on his computer. The guy thought okay, just a minute of that, but half an hour later he goes back and the boss is still watching it and he has popcorn in there. The guy went back to his desk, closed down and went home. Yep. True story.",,"Unfairness","Superhero","Alternative life",,
"The dreaded interns","The interns are coming next week. I try to be kind but really. These kids, they come in and everybody treats them like the whole place is a party. We pretend  not to have deadlines, we talk about creativity. Maybe we want to believe it but it's not true! And then behind their backs we get the real work done. Last year I ended up hiding from them so I could get my work done, because they think it's part of the job to sit around chatting about ideas. Sheesh.",,"Clueless","Alternative life",,,
"Priorities","So he says, we have to prioritize the configuration process. I said, there is no point in doing that before you standardize the file system, and he's like you don't understand our customers. I don't understand the customers! He doesn't understand the product! So I did what he said and it totally failed, and who gets blamed? Me.",,"Clueless","Top-down control",,,
"Details","What I would pass on of what I have learned? Don't obsess on details. We are supposed to submit a proposal of our ideas, right, and I stayed up all weekend and wrote the most beautiful 50 page thing you ever saw. The other proposals, when I saw them all I could think was, losers. They wrote like two page things that had no polish. Guess who won. They did. I heard the committee didn't even read past my second page. Wasted weekend.",,"Somehow","Clueless",,,
"Never trust a supplier","Oh, I know a story about that but I'm not telling. All I will say is, I will never trust a supplier again. That's all.",,"Nasty piece of work","Clueless",,,
"Couldn't wait","A time I couldn't wait to come to work? I would say there have been lots of times like that. One time? Hm. The time I was just about finished with my report on the watershed. I was putting the last touches on it, holding it up and looking at it from all angles. I felt confident, I knew it was needed, I knew I had done it well. It's times like that, when I know what I'm doing and know it's WORTH doing, that I come running in to work.",,"Top of the world","Superhero",,,
"The handshakes","I will never forget the day I came into the building for the first time. Every single person there shook my hand. I was like, are these people strange or what? It was only later I found out that new employees are always welcomed in that way. Now I do it myself. What a wonderful way to start things out.",,"Top of the world","Teamwork","Alternative life",,
"An amazing effort","I wouild just like to mention one incident that raised my respect for my boss (I won't say her name) last year. I was not here yet but I heard about this. Somebody fell on the job. You guys know who he was. He got his worker's compensation which was fine. He was home for two weeks. She stayed until late every night to get his work done. Some of us helped but she took charge of it. She told him to relax and heal. And when he came back it was like he had never gone, he had an easy time getting started again. She was exhausted, I'm sure! But happy. I have never before or since seen such a boss. If all of them were like that, this company would be a different place.",,"Superhero","Alternative life",,,
"A great idea killed","I had this great idea. They wanted a technical writer who knew some programming, right? That's why they hired me in the first place. So I got this great idea, it was to write a tutorial with some interactive screens. I knew how to do it, I could pull it off. But I told it to the programmers and they, well, they sort of crapped all over it. They said they didn't have time to test it, and it wouldn't meet their quality standards. Whatever. I think they just didn't want the writer treading on their space. It would have been great. But they killed it.",,"Unfairness","Top-down control",,,
"A hundred people","My cousin just retired, he was working at one of those custom manufacturing places down on route 50, do you know them? Anyway, when he left he made a list of a hundred people he knew at work, and their phone numbers and emails and all, so he could stay in touch. I thought, do I have a hundred people here I would want to keep in touch with? Do I have thirty? Says something about this place. Or maybe just about me.",,"Alternative life","Somehow",,,
"Working its way down","It's not a pretty story. The people who made the mistake would not own up to the mistake. It worked its way down. The person who ultimately got stuck with it had nothing to do with it. They were just the most defenceless. It's just the way we do things here. Nobody talks about it. It's impossible.",,"Unfairness","Top-down control","Somehow",,
