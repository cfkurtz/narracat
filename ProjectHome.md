<b>NarraCat</b> is a set of python scripts that call on the scipy and matplotlib libraries to support narrative catalysis.

<b>What is narrative catalysis?</b> It is simply looking for/at patterns in collected stories and in answers to questions about them in order to help people make sense of complex situations and make better decisions. The reason it's called catalysis rather than analysis is that it is meant to facilitate group sensemaking, not to arrive at answers, conclusions or proof. Narrative catalysis is an essential element of Participatory Narrative Inquiry. No, it's more like an optional element, but it's nice.

<b>What is Participatory Narrative Inquiry?</b> It is an approach I use to help people and groups work with stories to makes sense of situations, solve problems, make decisions and plan for the future.
